# Spectre
Open source GitHub repo for the Northstar bot `Spectre`, with the goal of 

1. Replacing the `#installation` channel with more up to date information 
2. Creating an automatic reply system to clean up public channels and attempt to move help to help related channels

Documentation on the commands can be found [here](https://github.com/CooldudePUGS/Spectre/wiki) and documentation of the reply triggers can be found [here](https://github.com/CooldudePUGS/Spectre/wiki/Replies). This won't be useful for many, but maybe someone in the future trying to make their own bot can relate this to the code to figure out how to use it themselves :)

Reach out with issues with a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/CooldudePUGS/Spectre/issues) or by dming cooldudepugs on Discord (if you'd rather not dm or don't have dms open, ping me in `development` or `northstar-chat` on the Northstar Discord server or something)

# Credits

[H0L0](https://github.com/H0L0theBard) was _incredibly_ important in creating this bot and helping me troubleshoot things I was incredibly stupid about. She is the only reason the code is nearly as clean as it is and has the nice structure that it has now

[Lumi](https://github.com/LumiKattlin) and [Liz](https://github.com/stygia-dev) helped create the original log reading while I was away on vacation

[Tony](https://github.com/cyrv6737) created the entire price searching functionality

[Gecko](https://github.com/GeckoEidechse) for introducing me to Poetry, as well as being the main reason I continued to write the bot
